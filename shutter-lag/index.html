        <p>Point your camera at the screen and try to capture the red umbrella as soon as it appears.
            The time below the umbrella on the photo will tell you how long it took you to capture the
            photo from the moment the umbrella appeared. Please note that this measures the shutter lag
            of the photographer + camera combination, not the shutter lag of the camera itself.</p>
        <p>Tips to minimize shutter lag: 1) Lock focus or use manual focus. 2) Half-press the shutter
            button in advance. 3) Use optical viewfinder or look sideways after framing the shot. 4)
            Turn off the electronic shutter if possible.</p>
