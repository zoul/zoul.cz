        <p>Point your camera at the screen and try to capture the red heart as soon as it appears.
        The time below the heart on the photo will tell you how long it took you to capture the
        photo from the moment the heart appeared.</p>
        <p>Please note that this measures the shutter lag in the most general sense, including the
        viewfinder and (most importantly) you. The resulting numbers should be averaged from several
        measurements and should not be directly compared with other people’s results (since the human
        factor is different). What you can safely compare is different approaches to shooting on your
        camera and general sources of latency.</p>
        <p>Tips to minimize shutter lag: 1) Lock focus or use manual focus. 2) Half-press the shutter
        button in advance. 3) Use optical viewfinder or look sideways, directly at the scene after
        framing the shot. 4) Turn off the electronic shutter if possible.</p>
